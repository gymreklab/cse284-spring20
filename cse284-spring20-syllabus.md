# Course Description

Genome-sequencing is quickly becoming a commodity, and more than a million people have already analyzed
their own genomes through direct-to-consumer companies. This course provides an introduction to current
bioinformatics techniques for analyzing and interpreting human genomes. We will learn how to interpret a single
genome in the context of an entire population, based on the often quoted concept: interpreting one genome
requires tens of thousands of genomes. Topics covered include an introduction to human medical and population
genetics, human ancestry, finding and interpreting disease-causing variants, genome-wide association studies,
genetic risk prediction, analyzing next generation sequencing data, and how to scale current genomics techniques
to analyze hundreds of thousands of genomes. We will also discuss the social impact of the personal genomics
revolution.

## Prerequisites
There are no official prerequisites for this course, but it is assumed students have some programming experience
and are familiar with using the UNIX command line.

## Course objectives
Though this course students will:
* Gain basic bioinformatics skills needed to analyze a personal genome using the UNIX command line.
* Gain the ability to critically read and interpret basic science and translational literature relevant to personal
genomics.
* Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the social impacts of the personal genomics revolution.
* Gain skills and experience necessary to carry out original research related to personal genomics.

## Course Structure

The course will consist of 5 modules (Intro, ancestry, trait prediction, NGS, special topics). Each module will have a corresponding problem set due at the end of the module. Problem sets will be completed on JupyterHub, and will consist of a mixture of autograded programing assignments and short answer questions.
We will have journal club discussions in class approximately every other week. For those discussions, you will be asked to submit some short answer questions before class.
Finally, each student will work in a group to complete a final project, described below.

Deadlines are set up such that at most 1 assignment is due in a given week (problem set, journal club, or project item).

## Course sessions
Lectures are held MW 3:00-4:50 by Zoom. Class meetings will consist of two sections separated by a short 5 minute break. The first section will usually
consist of a lecture (45 minutes). The second session (30 minutes) will consist either of a journal club discussion
or hands on experience using and developing bioinformatics methods. 

## Genotyping FAQ
The goal of this course is to teach you how to analyze your genome. At this time, we are not able to provide
genotyping or sequencing services to students, and instead homeworks will be performed on publicly available
human genomes. You are welcome to analyze your own genome using a direct-to-consumer service such as
23andme or Ancestry.com. You will also get access to a range of fun tools on their website that will complement some of the analyses we do in
class. Many homework assignments are built to analyze the type of data available from 23andme.

Please keep in mind the following:
* It is NOT required that you analyze your own genome. Your grade is in no way influenced by whether or
not you participate in 23andme.
* To ensure the previous point, you do not need to tell me if you will be analyzing your own genome.
* If you do 23andme, it is at your own risk and at your expense. We do not have funding to pay for the
test.
* While you are free to analyze your genome, you must still complete the homework assignments with the
provided genomes as well.
* 23andme can take up to six weeks, so sign up early if you want to use it during class.

# Grading

Your grade will be based on:
* Problem sets (65%)
* Journal club participation (10%)
* final projects (25%)

There will be one problem set for each module that will mostly involve performing analyses on genomes using
existing tools. PS1 is worth 5%. The other four problem sets are worth 15% each. Problem sets are graded out of 100 points. Late problem sets will lose five points for each day past the due date.

We will have 4 journal club discussions throughout the quarter. Short answer questions will be worth 2.5% each and will be graded out of 10 points.

The final project will consist of a proposal (5%), paper (15%), and presentation (5%). Full final project instructions will be posted soon.

Final grades will be out of 100 points. â‰¥70 points is passing. If you are taking the course for a letter grade, we
will use the following scale: A+:97-100, A:93-96, A-:90-92, B+:87-89, B:83-86, B-:80-82, C+:77-79, C:73-76,
C-:70-72, F:0-69.
